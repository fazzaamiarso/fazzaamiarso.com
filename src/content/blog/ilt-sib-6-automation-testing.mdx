I had another opportunity to teach a course on React.js, specifically focusing on automation testing.

Now, onto the fun part: reflecting on my teaching approach!

### Making it Engaging: Questions, Stories, and a Touch of Humor

I always try to start my lectures with a bang! I begin by asking a thought-provoking question, like, "Why is automation testing important?" The question gets the students thinking and helps them see the relevance of the topic.

I like to share stories to further emphasize the importance of automation testing. In this case, I talked about Jan Koum, the co-founder of WhatsApp, and his dedication to testing his app.

Lectures shouldn't be one-sided conversations! I've learned that students appreciate interactive learning. To achieve this, I ask them questions throughout the lecture and encourage them to explain concepts based on their understanding. We then discuss their answers, allowing them to learn from each other, regardless of whether their initial answers were perfectly correct.

Humor can be a powerful tool, too! I include relevant memes or short videos related to testing in my lecture. Seeing a funny clip can help students relax and become more receptive to the material.

### Learning by Doing: Demos and Real-World Examples

Technical concepts can be tricky to grasp without practical examples. That's why I heavily rely on demos during my lectures. By showing code examples and walking students through real-world codebases, I provide them with a clear starting point for implementing what they learn later on.

Overall, this teaching experience was incredibly rewarding, especially considering the complexity of the topic. Preparing and delivering the lecture also helped me learn a lot. The most satisfying part? Seeing the students engaged and understanding the value of automation testing in React.js development.
