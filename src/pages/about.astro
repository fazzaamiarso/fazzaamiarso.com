        I love building stuff on the web because I can freely express my Idea. Itâ€™s like having your
        own tiny space that show you exist in this world. Sharing knowledge and opinion, build
        useful application, craft stunning visual experience, make new friends and connections.

        I help other developer grows through various means, such as mentoring, facilitating, and
        teaching. I made most of my network and connections from participating as facilitator in
        scholarship programs.

        Since I was a child, Iâ€™m fascinated by the power that languages hold to connect with people
        simply by speaking a personâ€™s native language. I also believe that understanding the culture
        can open the door to peopleâ€™s heart. It motivated me to learn and understand different
        language and culture.
